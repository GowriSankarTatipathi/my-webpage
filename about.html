    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am Gowri Sankar Reddy Tatipathi, a Computer Science graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington. I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. My academic journey so far has been both exciting and enriching.</p>
    <p>Outside my studies, I have a keen interest in exploring new places and experiencing different cultures. I enjoy trekking, as it allows me to connect with nature and challenge myself physically. Watching cricket is another passion of mine; I never miss an exciting match!</p>
    <p>When it comes to hobbies, I love playing badminton and working out to stay fit and active. Cricket is not just a sport for me—it’s something I deeply enjoy playing with friends. These activities keep me energized and balanced in life.</p>
